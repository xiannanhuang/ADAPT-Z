# ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in Z-space) algorithm, along with supplementary experiments from the paper and implementations of baselines

This codebase is primarily based on DSOF (Fast and Slow Streams for Online Time Series Forecasting Without Information Leakage, ICLR 2025; paper: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=I0n3EyogMi, repository: https://github.com/yyalau/iclr2025_dsof) to experimentally validate the ADAPT-Z algorithm.
